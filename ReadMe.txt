1) Theme: You were a small, peaceful and independent country that lived its own life until a new neighbor appeared at your border -- SOVIET UNION! Soviets occupied you and now you have to fight for your own freedom. Nurture your own national identity by collecting cultural symbols and once back to your original strength becomes independent again! However, your path ahead is not easy. Different Soviet leaders absolutely don't want you to be an independent state! If you encounter them, they will try their best to stop you by limiting your freedoms and destabilizing your environment. So try to avoid them!

The main player is depicted as a map of Georgia with its flag painted into it that country had before the Soviet occupation. For collectible cultural symbols that benefit you, I used Borjgalo, an ancient Georgian symbol for Sun and Eternity, and Golden Grapes, which refers to 8 000 years-old Georgian tradition of winemaking. 

I used images/gifs of Hammer & Sickle, Stalin, and Gorbachev for the collectible objects that can harm you. The fact Stalin's objects have the ability to block your access to movement keys is a reference to the repressions caused by his regime in the late 1930ies. On the other hand, Gorbachev's collectible makes Hammer & Sickles move chaotically, which is a reference to the Georgian civil war and chaos that resulted after his ineffective dissolution of the Soviet Union. 

The first level of the game uses a post-apocalyptic painting of Moscow, the former capital of the Soviet Union. Once a player collects a certain number of points, the game goes into the second level, where the painting of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, is used as a background. If a player collects enough Ind-Points (Independence Points) to win, the background switches to a beautiful image of Svaneti, which located in the high mountains of Georgia was the last region that the Soviet Union occupied. If the player loses the game, the background changes to the shattered flag of the Soviet Union. 

2) FEATURES & MECHANICS: 
    General Features:
    1) If the player collects Borjgalos (Suns), he gains 20 Ind-Points
    2) If the player collects Golden Grapes, he gains 20 Ind-Points and gains 1 extra life
    3) Player starts with 3 lives
    4) Touching either Hammer & Sickle, Stalin or Gorbachev makes the player lose 1 life
    5) Motion of the player is controlled by the arrow keys and the game can be paused by pressing the 'P' key
    
    Unique/Custom Features:
    1) Every time player collides with Stalin, he loses an arrow key to control the player object. Loss of arrow keys happens in the following order: Right, Left, Down, and Up. Every time player collects Golden Grapes, he regains one of the lost arrow keys. 
    2) The first time player collides with the Gorbachev, Hammer & Sickles gain vertical velocities and thus start moving diagonally. The second time player touches Gorbachev, Hammer & Sickles' speed increases and becomes randomized, making it harder for the player to avoid them. In order to cancel any effects caused by Gorbachev, the player needs to collect 3 Golden Grapes without touching any Gorbachevs while collecting them. 
    3) Game is split into two levels: Moscow and Tbilisi. Once the player collects 400 Ind-Points, he transitions from Moscow to Tbilisi where 66% more objects are spawned per unit of time and the speed of the game increases by 20%. 

3) WIN/LOSE CONDITIONS:
    The player Wins if he manages to collect 800 Ind-Points without losing all his lives. The player Loses if he loses all his lives before collecting 800 Ind-Points.
